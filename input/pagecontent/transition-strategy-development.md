### Strategy Development

Based on the [assessment](transition-assessment.html), develop a transition strategy that addresses the specific needs and constraints of the organization. The strategy should provide a clear roadmap for transitioning from the existing provider directory system to the FHIR-based system.

#### Pattern Selection

Select the appropriate [transition pattern(s)](transition-patterns.html) based on organizational needs and constraints:

##### Risk Tolerance

Evaluate the organization's appetite for risk during the transition:

- **Risk Assessment**: Analyze the potential impact of transition-related disruptions on business operations, including effects on provider enrollment, claims processing, member access to care, and regulatory compliance.
  
- **Critical Functions**: Identify provider directory functions that are mission-critical and cannot tolerate disruption, such as those affecting patient care, revenue cycle, or compliance with regulatory requirements.
  
- **Stakeholder Expectations**: Understand stakeholder expectations regarding transition safety and reliability, including leadership tolerance for service interruptions, user acceptance of temporary limitations, and partner requirements for interface stability.
  
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Evaluate regulatory requirements that may affect the transition approach, including mandated timelines, required capabilities, and compliance reporting obligations.
  
- **Pattern Implications**: Assess how each transition pattern aligns with the organization's risk profile, considering that parallel operation typically offers the lowest operational risk but higher resource requirements, while data migration may present higher short-term risk but cleaner long-term results.

##### Resource Availability

Assess available resources for the transition:

- **Technical Expertise**: Evaluate the availability of staff with relevant skills, including FHIR knowledge, healthcare interoperability experience, data migration expertise, and familiarity with the existing system.
  
- **Budget Constraints**: Determine the financial resources available for the transition, including funding for software, infrastructure, consulting services, training, and potential temporary dual operations.
  
- **Infrastructure Capacity**: Assess the availability of technical infrastructure to support the transition, including development, testing, and production environments, as well as any additional capacity needed for parallel operations.
  
- **Timeline Flexibility**: Evaluate constraints on the transition timeline, including how quickly the transition must be completed and whether a phased approach is feasible given business and regulatory deadlines.
  
- **Support Capabilities**: Assess the organization's capacity to support users and systems during the transition, including help desk resources, training capacity, and operational support for potential parallel environments.

##### Timeline Constraints

Analyze schedule requirements and deadlines:

- **Regulatory Deadlines**: Identify any compliance dates that must be met, such as those mandated by the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule or state-specific requirements.
  
- **Fiscal Year Considerations**: Align the transition timeline with budget cycles and fiscal year planning to ensure appropriate resource allocation and financial management.
  
- **Coordination with Other Initiatives**: Evaluate how the transition timeline must be coordinated with other organizational initiatives, such as system upgrades, policy changes, or strategic initiatives.
  
- **User Availability**: Consider the availability of users for activities such as requirements gathering, testing, and training, accounting for seasonal variations in workload and competing priorities.
  
- **Pattern Implications**: Assess how each transition pattern aligns with timeline constraints, considering that API facade may offer the fastest path to FHIR compliance, while phased replacement allows for incremental progress over a longer period.

##### Technical Constraints

Identify technical limitations and requirements:

- **Legacy System Architecture**: Evaluate the architecture of the existing system, including its flexibility for integration, data extraction capabilities, and potential for coexistence with new components.
  
- **Data Complexity**: Assess the complexity of provider data, including volume, quality issues, custom data elements, and relationships that may affect data migration or transformation.
  
- **Interface Dependencies**: Identify dependencies on existing interfaces, including the feasibility of adapting them to work with FHIR and the potential impact of interface changes on dependent systems.
  
- **Security Requirements**: Evaluate security constraints that may affect the transition, including authentication mechanisms, data protection requirements, and audit capabilities.
  
- **Performance Expectations**: Understand performance requirements for the provider directory, including response times, throughput, and availability expectations that must be maintained during and after the transition.

##### Operational Constraints

Consider operational realities and limitations:

- **Business Hours**: Identify operational hours during which system changes may be limited, including peak usage periods, business cycles, and maintenance windows.
  
- **Maintenance Windows**: Determine available windows for system maintenance, updates, and cutover activities that minimize impact on business operations.
  
- **Peak Usage Periods**: Identify times of high system usage that should be avoided for major transition activities, such as enrollment periods, fiscal year-end, or seasonal peaks.
  
- **Operational Staff Availability**: Assess the availability of operational staff to support the transition, including their capacity to handle potential increases in support needs during the transition.
  
- **Business Process Dependencies**: Identify critical business processes that depend on the provider directory and may constrain the timing or approach of the transition.

##### Pattern Selection Decision

Based on the above factors, select the most appropriate transition pattern(s):

- **Parallel Operation**: Consider this pattern when risk mitigation is the highest priority, resources are available for maintaining dual systems, and the organization needs extensive validation before cutover.
  
- **Phased Replacement**: Select this pattern when the transition complexity is high, risk must be distributed across multiple implementation steps, and the organization can benefit from learning opportunities between phases.
  
- **API Facade**: Choose this pattern when rapid FHIR compliance is required, minimal disruption to existing systems is essential, or the organization wants to incrementally modernize the underlying system while maintaining a stable API.
  
- **Data Migration**: Opt for this pattern when a clean implementation is desired, the organization wants to eliminate technical debt, and a well-defined cutover with potential downtime is acceptable.
  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Consider combining patterns when different aspects of the transition have different requirements, such as using an API facade for immediate compliance while planning a phased replacement for long-term modernization.

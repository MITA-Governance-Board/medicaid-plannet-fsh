The following principles should guide the implementation of a testing framework:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all aspects of the implementation, including conformance, functionality, performance, and security. This principle ensures that testing addresses not only the technical correctness of the implementation but also its usability, reliability, and security posture, providing a holistic assessment of the system's quality and readiness for production deployment [2].

2. **Automation**: Automate testing wherever possible to ensure consistency and repeatability. Automated testing reduces human error, enables frequent execution of comprehensive test suites, and provides consistent results across different environments and test runs, making it possible to detect regressions quickly and maintain high quality throughout the development lifecycle [3].

3. **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing into the development process and perform testing continuously. This approach shifts testing left in the development lifecycle, identifying issues earlier when they are less costly to fix, and ensures that quality is built into the product from the beginning rather than being assessed only at the end of development [4].

4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with realistic scenarios that reflect actual use cases. Using scenarios derived from real-world usage patterns ensures that testing evaluates the system under conditions that match how it will be used in production, validating not just that individual components work correctly but that they work together to support end-to-end business processes [5].

5. **Incremental Approach**: Implement testing incrementally, starting with basic tests and adding more complex tests over time. This approach allows testing to evolve alongside the implementation, focusing initial efforts on core functionality and gradually expanding to cover edge cases, performance scenarios, and security considerations as the implementation matures [6].

### Overview

This Implementation Guide (IG) provides a framework for transitioning from existing provider directory systems to FHIR-based provider directories. Transitioning to a FHIR-based provider directory requires careful planning, execution, and monitoring to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to operations. This guidance outlines approaches for implementing a transition strategy for Medicaid provider directories.

### Transition Principles

The following principles should guide the implementation of a transition strategy:

1. **Incremental Approach**: Implement the transition in phases rather than all at once.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing systems during the transition.
3. **Data Quality**: Ensure data quality throughout the transition process.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage stakeholders throughout the transition process.
5. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate risks associated with the transition.

### Transition Patterns

#### Parallel Operation

The parallel operation pattern involves running the existing system and the new FHIR-based system in parallel for a period of time. This pattern provides the following benefits:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces the risk of disruption by allowing fallback to the existing system.
2. **Validation**: Enables validation of the new system against the existing system.
3. **Gradual Transition**: Allows for a gradual transition of users and systems to the new system.
4. **Operational Continuity**: Ensures operational continuity during the transition.

##### Implementation Approach

1. **Dual Data Entry**: Implement processes for entering data into both systems.
2. **Data Synchronization**: Implement mechanisms for synchronizing data between systems.
3. **Validation**: Validate the new system against the existing system.
4. **Gradual Cutover**: Gradually transition users and systems to the new system.
5. **Decommissioning**: Decommission the existing system once the transition is complete.

##### Considerations

1. **Resource Requirements**: Requires resources to maintain both systems.
2. **Data Consistency**: Requires mechanisms to ensure data consistency between systems.
3. **User Training**: Requires training users on both systems.
4. **Operational Complexity**: Increases operational complexity during the transition.

### Conclusion

Transitioning to a FHIR-based provider directory requires careful planning, execution, and monitoring. By implementing a comprehensive transition strategy, Medicaid agencies can minimize disruption, manage risk, and ensure a successful transition.

This guidance provides a framework for implementing a transition strategy for Medicaid provider directories. Implementers should adapt this guidance to their specific needs and constraints, taking into account their existing systems, resources, timeline, and stakeholder requirements.

Regular assessment and adjustment of the transition strategy are essential to address evolving needs and changing circumstances. Medicaid agencies should establish a continuous improvement process for the transition, including regular review of progress, stakeholder feedback, and risk assessment.

Transitioning to a FHIR-based provider directory requires careful planning, execution, and monitoring. By implementing a comprehensive transition strategy, Medicaid agencies can minimize disruption, manage risk, and ensure a successful transition.

This guidance provides a framework for implementing a transition strategy for Medicaid provider directories. Implementers should adapt this guidance to their specific needs and constraints, taking into account their existing systems, resources, timeline, and stakeholder requirements.

Regular assessment and adjustment of the transition strategy are essential to address evolving needs and changing circumstances. Medicaid agencies should establish a continuous improvement process for the transition, including regular review of progress, stakeholder feedback, and risk assessment.

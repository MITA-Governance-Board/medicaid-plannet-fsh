3. **Challenges**:
   - **Handling large volumes of data** - Technical complexity in managing the migration of extensive provider information, including performance challenges with extracting and processing millions of records, memory and storage requirements for transformation operations, optimization needs for bulk loading into the FHIR server, time constraints for completing the migration within available windows, and resource demands for processing large datasets, potentially requiring specialized hardware or cloud resources, batch processing strategies, performance optimization techniques, and careful planning to handle the scale of provider data typically found in state Medicaid systems without excessive downtime or resource consumption [8].
   - **Addressing data quality issues** - Significant effort required to handle data problems discovered during migration, including development of data cleansing procedures for common issues, implementation of data enrichment from authoritative sources, establishment of business rules for handling incomplete or inconsistent data, creation of exception management processes for problematic records, and design of validation rules to ensure FHIR compliance, potentially uncovering long-standing data problems that require business decisions, manual intervention for complex cases, and governance processes to establish data quality standards and resolution approaches [4].
   - **Managing downtime during cutover** - Operational challenges in transitioning between systems, including careful planning of the cutover window to minimize business impact, communication with all stakeholders about service availability, coordination of technical activities to minimize downtime duration, preparation for unexpected issues that might extend the outage, and development of contingency plans for critical functions, potentially requiring weekend or off-hours work, careful sequencing of cutover activities, clear go/no-go criteria, and executive support for the temporary service interruption if a "hot" cutover is not feasible [8].
   - **Ensuring complete data migration** - Verification challenges to confirm that all provider information has been successfully migrated, including development of comprehensive reconciliation processes between source and target systems, implementation of data completeness checks across all resource types, establishment of procedures to identify and resolve any missing data, creation of audit trails for the migration process, and design of monitoring to detect any synchronization issues, potentially requiring sophisticated comparison algorithms, statistical sampling approaches for large datasets, and multiple validation passes to achieve high confidence in migration completeness [8].
   - **Verifying data accuracy after migration** - Quality assurance complexity to confirm the correctness of migrated data, including implementation of automated validation against business rules and FHIR profiles, organization of manual review by subject matter experts for complex data elements, execution of end-to-end testing of key provider directory functions, comparison of system outputs between old and new systems, and collection of user feedback during initial operation, potentially requiring significant quality assurance resources, development of specialized validation tools, and establishment of formal sign-off procedures to certify the accuracy of the migrated provider directory [9].

4. **Benefits**:
   - **Clean implementation of the new system** - Architectural advantage of building on a fresh foundation, including opportunity to implement a pure FHIR-native design without legacy constraints, ability to optimize the data model specifically for FHIR resources, freedom to incorporate modern architectural patterns and best practices, chance to eliminate accumulated technical debt and workarounds, and flexibility to design for current and future requirements rather than backward compatibility, supporting long-term system health, enabling more straightforward maintenance and enhancement, and facilitating better alignment with healthcare interoperability standards and practices [8].
   - **Opportunity to improve data quality** - Data enhancement possibilities inherent in the migration process, including systematic identification and correction of inaccuracies in the source data, standardization of formats and terminologies according to industry norms, enrichment with additional information from authoritative sources, elimination of duplicates and inconsistencies through migration rules, and implementation of stronger validation to prevent future quality issues, supporting overall improvement in provider information quality, enabling more reliable provider directory services, and establishing a cleaner foundation for the FHIR-based system than existed in the legacy environment [4].
   - **Simplified architecture after migration** - Technical streamlining through consolidation on a single platform, including elimination of synchronization mechanisms that would be needed in parallel or phased approaches, removal of temporary bridges or adapters between old and new components, reduction in the number of environments to maintain and monitor, simplification of the operational support model, and clarification of the system of record for all provider data, supporting reduced operational complexity, enabling more efficient system management, and facilitating clearer understanding of the technical landscape for all stakeholders [12].
   - **Elimination of legacy technical debt** - Strategic advantage of completely replacing outdated technology, including removal of obsolete platforms and languages that may have limited support, replacement of custom code with standards-based implementations, elimination of workarounds developed for historical limitations, retirement of aging infrastructure with increasing maintenance costs, and discontinuation of vendor products that may be approaching end-of-life, supporting reduced maintenance burden, enabling more resources to be focused on new capabilities rather than sustaining legacy systems, and facilitating more rapid response to changing requirements without legacy constraints [12].
   - **Clear transition point for users and systems** - Organizational clarity provided by a definitive cutover, including unambiguous communication about when to use the new system, simplified training that focuses solely on the new environment without explaining transition states, consistent experience for all users who transition at the same time, clear delineation of support responsibilities before and after cutover, and well-defined success criteria for the transition, supporting effective change management, enabling clean completion of the transition project, and facilitating clear measurement of the benefits realized from the new FHIR-based provider directory [7].

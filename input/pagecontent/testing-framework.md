## Examples

### Example 1: Conformance Testing

A state Medicaid agency implements conformance testing for its provider directory:

1. **Implementation**:
   - Set up a FHIR validation server
   - Configure validation profiles for Medicaid PlanNet
   - Develop validation test cases
   - Implement automated validation testing
   - Integrate validation into the CI/CD pipeline

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Validate MedicaidPractitioner resources against the MedicaidPractitioner profile
   - Validate MedicaidOrganization resources against the MedicaidOrganization profile
   - Validate MedicaidNetwork resources against the MedicaidNetwork profile
   - Validate search parameter support for all required parameters
   - Validate operation support for all required operations

3. **Results**:
   - Identify and fix profile conformance issues
   - Ensure all required search parameters are supported
   - Verify that all required operations function correctly
   - Document conformance status for all profiles
   - Generate conformance statements for the implementation

### Example 2: Functional Testing

A state Medicaid agency implements functional testing for its provider directory:

1. **Implementation**:
   - Develop test cases for key user scenarios
   - Implement automated functional tests
   - Set up test environments
   - Prepare test data
   - Integrate functional testing into the CI/CD pipeline

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Test provider enrollment workflow
   - Test provider search functionality
   - Test network adequacy assessment
   - Test provider directory API
   - Test user interface functionality

3. **Results**:
